# Tooltips
smart_memory_tooltip: |-
  <b>ðŸ’¡ Smart Memory Module</b><br><br>
  This feature enables characters to <b>remember important details</b> from your conversation.<br><br>
  The system <b>intelligently analyzes</b> your chat history and retrieves only the information that's semantically relevant to your current message.
  This way, you don't need to worry about context window limitations, while text generation speed remains high and unaffected.<br><br>

  <b>Example:</b><br>
  If you said: <i>"I don't like cats"</i>, the character will remember this information later, 
  even if it was mentioned 100 messages ago.

ambient_sound_tooltip: |-
  <b>ðŸŽµ Ambient Sound Module</b><br><br>
  This feature adds an <b>atmospheric sound</b> when entering a chat with a character.<br><br>
  After switching on, you can choose the appropriate <b>ambient</b> â€” background music or sounds that will create the right mood:
  whether it's a noisy wind, the sound of raindrops or the cozy crackle of a campfire.<br><br>

  <b>Example:</b><br>
  If you are chatting with a character in a <i>Tavern</i>,
  you can choose an ambient with <i>the sound of a noisy crowd and a cheerful melody</i>, 
  to immerse yourself in the atmosphere of the place and strengthen the emotional connection with the character.

sow_system_tooltip: |-
  <b>âœ¨ Soul of Waifu System</b><br><br>
  This is the <b>advanced mode</b> of the program, which will unleash <b>the full potential</b> of your communication with characters.<br><br>
  You can:<br>
  â€¢ Assign avatars to characters â€” static or gif images, animated Live2D models or volumetric VRM models;<br>
  â€¢ Call characters â€” communicate through a microphone in a special interface made specifically for this mode;<br>
  â€¢ Connect additional modules: smart memory, ambient, translator and many others.

gpu_layers_tooltip: |-
  <b>GPU Layer Offloading</b><br><br>
  This setting lets you <b>control how much of LLM</b> runs directly on your GPU, balancing <b>speed</b> and <b>video memory usage</b>.<br><br>
  The more layers loaded into VRAM, the faster the model responds â€” but the higher the GPU memory demand.<br>
  You can manually adjust how many layers are offloaded, making it possible to run large models even on mid-range or entry-level GPUs.<br><br>

  <b>Example:</b><br>
  If you have a <i>GPU with 8GB VRAM</i>, you can offload 20 out of 32 layers â€” 
  enough for smooth performance without overloading your system.<br><br>

  ðŸ’¡ <i>Especially useful for large models (13B and above). The stronger your GPU, the more layers you can assign.</i>

context_size_tooltip: |-
  <b>Context Window</b><br><br>
  This is the <b>memory capacity</b> the language model uses when generating a response. 
  It includes your chat history, author's notes, character information, and entries from your lorebooks.<br><br>
  A larger context window means the character can <b>remember more of the conversation</b>, 
  but it increases memory usage and may slow down response speed.<br><br>

  ðŸ’¡ <i>Recommended to reduce on weaker PCs. 
  Maximum value depends on the model and available memory. 
  But using the Smart Memory module, you can optimize work with the chat context.</i>

mlock_tooltip: |-
  <b>MLock (Memory Lock)</b><br><br>
  This feature <b>prevents the language model</b> from being unloaded from RAM, even when the system tries to free up memory.<br><br>
  When enabled, the model stays fully loaded in memory, ensuring the <b>fastest possible response time</b> for every new message.<br><br>
  However, it increases overall RAM usage, and memory is only freed when you fully close the application or just disable the model.

flashattention_tooltip: |-
  <b>Flash Attention</b><br><br>
  This technology <b>speeds up the language model</b> and <b>reduces VRAM usage</b> when processing long conversations.<br><br>
  It optimizes internal computations, making text generation <b>faster and more efficient</b>, especially with large context windows (4K, 8K and above).<br><br>

  <b>Important:</b><br>
  This feature works <b>only with NVIDIA GPUs</b> (via CUDA technology).<br>
  It is <b>automatically disabled</b> on AMD, Intel graphics, or when running on CPU.<br><br>

  ðŸ’¡ <i>Works best with features like Smart Memory or long chat histories. 
  If you have an NVIDIA GPU, enable it for maximum performance.</i>

temperature_tooltip: |-
  <b>Model Temperature</b><br><br>
  This setting controls how <b>creative or predictable</b> the character's responses will be.<br><br>
  â€¢ <b>Low (0.1â€“0.5)</b> â€” precise, logical, textbook-style answers.<br>
  â€¢ <b>Medium (0.6â€“0.8)</b> â€” balanced mix of sense and spontaneity.<br>
  â€¢ <b>High (0.9â€“1.5)</b> â€” surprising, emotional, witty, or sarcastic replies.<br><br>

  ðŸ’¡ <i>Recommended: 0.7â€“0.9 for natural conversation. Lower it if the character starts "making things up".</i>

top_p_tooltip: |-
  <b>Top P (Response Flexibility)</b><br><br>
  This setting controls <b>how broadly the model chooses words</b> when generating a response.<br><br>
  Model "thinking" about the next word. Top P decides <b>how many options it considers</b>:<br>
  â€¢ <b>Low (0.1â€“0.5)</b> â€” picks only the most obvious words. Responses are predictable, but can feel flat.<br>
  â€¢ <b>Medium (0.7â€“0.9)</b> â€” balanced between sense and natural flow. Great for conversations.<br>
  â€¢ <b>High (0.95â€“1.0)</b> â€” includes rare or surprising words. Speech feels alive, but may get weird.<br><br>

  ðŸ’¡ <i>Recommended: 0.8â€“0.95. Combine with temperature.</i>

repeat_penalty_tooltip: |-
  <b>Repeat Penalty</b><br><br>
  This setting helps the character <b>avoid repeating the same words, phrases, or ideas</b> over and over.<br><br>
  The higher the value, the more the model <b>penalizes itself for repeating</b> what's already been said.<br>
  This makes responses more varied and natural, especially in longer answers.<br><br>

  <b>Example:</b><br>
  Without penalty, the character might say:<br>
  <i>"It's important, it's important, it's important..."</i><br>
  With high penalty:<br>
  <i>"It's importantâ€”not just because survival is at stake, but because we've already lost too much."</i>

max_tokens_tooltip: |-
  <b>Max Response Length</b><br><br>
  This setting controls <b>how long the character's reply can be</b>.<br><br>
  
  ðŸ’¡ <i>Very long responses eat up context space. 
  Recommended: 200â€“400 tokens for answers. Only increase when deeper answers are needed.</i>

personas_button_tooltip: "<b>Opens personas editor</b><br><br>Allows you to create, edit, select and delete personas - information about the user who will communicate with the characters."

system_prompt_button_tooltip: |-
  Here you can <b>customize the system prompt</b> for the language model â€” how the character should behave during your conversations.<br><br>

  You can:<br>
  â€¢ <b>Edit the prompt text</b> â€” adjust tone, add speech patterns or quirks.<br>
  â€¢ <b>Reorder components</b> â€” control the priority of information.<br><br>

  <b>Why does order matter?</b><br>
  The model remembers best what appears <b>closer to the end</b> of the prompt.<br>
  If you want the character to reference lore more often â€” move the Lorebook to the end.<br>
  If their personality is most important â€” place Character Info last.<br><br>

  <b>Editor of lorebooks</b><br><br>
  A lorebook is a <b>reference book</b> that helps a character remember important events, terms, places, and characters.<br><br>
  When you mention something from the lorebook, the program <b>automatically connects the necessary information</b> to the query, and the character responds as if he really knows it.<br><br>

  <b>What you can do:</b><br>
  â€¢ <b>Create and delete lorebooks</b>.<br>
  â€¢ <b>Add entries</b> â€” each block of information: place, character, event, term.<br>
  â€¢ <b>Edit keywords</b> â€” what should the entry "include".<br>
  â€¢ <b>Choose the scan depth</b> â€” how many recent messages to analyze for matches.<br><br>

  <b>Example:</b><br>
  You are adding an entry:<br>
  â€¢ <i>Text:</i> "Soul of Waifu is a program that allows you to communicate with AI."<br>
  â€¢ <i>Keywords:</i> Soul of Waifu, AI<br>
  When you say: <i>"What is Soul of Waifu?"</i>, the character will remember and respond with information about this entry.
